Orchid is a lightweight, composable language for describing *how AI agents should think* - not just what they should compute. It bridges the gap between natural language prompts and procedural code, giving you human-readable scripts that are machine-executable.

```orchid
@orchid 0.1
@name "Quick Research Brief"

sources := fork:
    academic: Search("quantum computing breakthroughs 2024")
    industry: Search("quantum computing commercial applications")

vetted := CoVe(sources)                            # verify claims against evidence
analysis := CoT(vetted)<deep>                      # chain-of-thought reasoning

if Confidence(analysis) > 0.7:
    Formal(analysis)<cite>                         # high confidence → rigorous report
else:
    ELI5(analysis) + Explain("uncertainty areas")  # low confidence → be transparent
```

Read it aloud. You don't need to be a programmer to understand what this agent will do.

## Getting Started

### Install from npm
```bash
npm install -g @orchid-dsl/orchid
orchid examples/hello_world.orch
```
### From source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/orchid-dsl/orchid.git
cd orchid && npm install && npm run build
node dist/cli.js examples/hello_world.orch
```

See the [Quickstart guide](QUICKSTART.md) for MCP setup and more.

## Why Orchid?

**The problem:** We're orchestrating increasingly sophisticated AI agents using either raw prompts (fragile, non-composable) or general-purpose programming languages (verbose, obscures intent). A product manager can't review a LangChain pipeline. A researcher can't reproduce a prompt chain from a Python script.

**The approach:** Orchid treats reasoning as a first-class primitive. Instead of writing code *about* API calls, you write scripts *about* cognition - with named reasoning strategies, confidence-aware control flow, and parallel execution built into the syntax.

| Feature | Orchid | Python + LangChain | YAML Configs | DSPy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Human-readable | ✓ | ✗ | ~ | ✗ |
| Reasoning as primitives | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ~ |
| Native confidence handling | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Composable agents | ✓ | ~ | ✗ | ~ |
| Parallel execution | ✓ | ~ | ✗ | ✗ |
| No programming required | ✓ | ✗ | ~ | ✗ |
| Tool integration (MCP) | ✓ | ~ | ~ | ✗ |
| Formal grammar | ✓ | N/A | ✓ | ✗ |

## Key Concepts

### Reasoning Macros
Named cognitive operations that shape *how* an agent thinks. Not functions that transform data - patterns of thought.

```orchid
CoT("analyze market trends")          # chain-of-thought deliberation
CoVe(claims)                          # chain-of-verification fact-checking
RedTeam(plan)                         # adversarial analysis
ELI5(report)                          # simplify for general audience
Debate("should we expand to EU?", count=3)  # 3-perspective argumentation
```

### Confidence-Aware Control Flow
Agent operations don't just succeed or fail - they exist on a spectrum. Orchid makes uncertainty a native concept.

```orchid
while Confidence() < 0.7:
    Search("additional evidence")<append>
    Refine(analysis)
```

### Parallel Execution
Fork operations run concurrently and collect results.

```orchid
data := fork:
    market: Search("EV market data")
    tech: Search("battery R&D breakthroughs")
    policy: Search("EV policy incentives")

report := Consensus(data)
```

### Tags (Behavior Modifiers)
Fine-grained control over how operations execute, without changing what they do.

```orchid
Search("topic")<deep, retry=3, timeout=30s>
CoT("sensitive analysis")<private, verbose>
Validate(output, criteria="complete")<retry=5, fallback=draft>
```

### MCP Tool Integration
First-class integration with the Model Context Protocol for external tool access. Use real MCP servers for filesystem, databases, web search, GitHub, and more.

```orchid
@requires MCP("filesystem")

tree := filesystem:directory_tree(path="src")
pkg := filesystem:read_text_file(path="package.json")
analysis := CoT("describe this project:\n$tree\n$pkg")
filesystem:write_file(path="/tmp/summary.md", content=analysis)
```

Install servers with one command:

```bash
node dist/cli.js mcp install filesystem brave-search memory github
```
